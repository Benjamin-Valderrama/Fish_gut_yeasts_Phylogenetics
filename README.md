## Phylogenetic analysis of yeasts isolated from the gut of *Genypterus chilensis* and *Seriolella violacea*.

This analysis is part of the Valderrama et al (2021) Open Access paper entitled ["Cultivable Yeast Microbiota from the Marine Fish Species Genypterus chilensis and Seriolella violacea"](https://www.mdpi.com/2309-608X/7/7/515/htm). In that paper you can find more details of the experimental procedures to obtain the data. Additionally, raw sequences can be found in the GenBank database under the accession codes [MW567218 to MW567237](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/?term=MW567218:MW567237[accn]).


## Commitment to reproducibility:

All the packages used in this project are under constant mantainance. However, newer versions can modify the expected output of the pipeline making it slightly different of what it was intended to look like. To tackle this potential issue, in this project I used the renv package which keep tracks of the version of each of the packages used here (as well as their dependencies). In order to recreate the exact same results at the moment you re-run the analysis, at the beginning of the code you can find how to automatically get the versions of the packages used here.


## In this repository you can find:

**code :** The R code used to produce the results

**data :** The data before and after the MSA

**notebook :** A laboratoy notebook in a '.txt' file

**renv :** A folder with the information needed to ensure reproducibility using the renv package

**renv.lock :** A file with all the details regarding the packages, versions and dependencies used for this project.
