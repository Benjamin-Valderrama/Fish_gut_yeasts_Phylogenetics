**Title :** Phylogenetic Analysis of cultivable yeasts from the gut of two fishes

**Author :** Benjamin Valderrama

Here I share all the supplies needed to conduct a phylogenetic analysis of the Yeasts microbiota isolated from the intestinal content of two marine fish from Chile, Genypterus chilensis and Seriolella violacea.

All sequences can be found in the GenBank database under the accession codes MW567218 to MW567237. Additionally, more details of the experimental procedures to obtain the data can be found in the following [Open Access paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2309-608X/7/7/515/htm)
