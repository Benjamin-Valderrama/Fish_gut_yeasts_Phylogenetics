1. I Fond a sequence of Debaryomyces hansenii in NCBI to use it as an outgroup

2. I conducted an MSA using MEGA (version 10.2.6). The alignment was curated so only positions with >75% of coverage were kept

1. I did the best-fit model analysis. The output of the analysis was stored in the "exploratory fold" of the repository under the name "best-fit-model_mega-output.txt"

2. I constructed the phylogenetic tree using R with the "T92" substitution model. However, It seems to be that D. hansenii is not a good outgroup for my dataset

* Personal comment: 
	- It is obvious that the data itself won't allow me to make a reliable identification of the yeast at deep taxonomic levels. 
	- My phylogenetic tree is coherent with the one depicted in the paper, altough they use different substitution models. I need to check the differences between K80 and T92.

1. I did another MSA without outgroup

2. I found a workflow for tree construction in R using phangorn and ape. I used it.

3. I constructed a phylogenetic tree using distance methods (with UPGMA algorithm) and bootstrap to support the nodes.
